I am trying to compress a pdf file by making a dictionary and mapping its index

further compression is needed....

I have compressed a book of ice and fire which was 1.53MB size into 1.16MB for now

but further dividing the csv files into second layer will compress it further more

It is time consuming to decompress and process but this compression is needed for least used pdf files for a unnecessary space consumption.

In further steps i will compress csv file data and make a new layer of compression on it which might decrease its size by 30 to 40 percent

as it is compression it also displays a property of cryptography as it is not easily readable as it is spreaded in compression layer.
